This is my first personal project repository.
After being introduced to Python in CS 417 - Topics in OOP, I wanted to be more comfortable with Python.
when I could, I added to this repo over the break between classes.

The Plan: Recreate a budget tracking application similar to EveryDollar by Ramsey Solutions for my own personal use.
To do so, I wanted to utilize Python and SQL to read and write to a database of planned income and expenses hosted on a raspberry pi 4.
Every month has a budget with total income divided into planned expense cateories. 
As money is spent, the user will add a record detailing the date, amount, category, and details (on what/where) of the expense.
This is store in the database so that the application can later read these records and calculated remaining funds, over/under amount and percentage, and export the record into different file formats.
Once this is done, I could look into expanding support for devices other than my home PC- other computers, mobile devices, etc.

Planned Outcome:
+Python Experience
+SQL Experience
+Pi/Debian/Networking Experience
  >The raspberry pi would finally be put to use!
+Have a budget tracking app with premium features for free
